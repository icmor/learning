				<h1>Linux</h1>
				<hr>
				<p>
					Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel,
					<sup>[10]</sup> an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds.
					<sup>[11][12][13]</sup> Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution.
				</p>

				<p>
					Popular Linux distributions<sup>[16][17][18]</sup> include
					<a href="https://www.debian.org"> Debian </a>,
					<a href="https://getfedora.org"> Fedora</a>, and
					<a href="https://ubuntu.com"> Ubuntu</a>.
					Commercial distributions include
					<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux">
						Red Hat Enterprise Linux</a> and
					<a href="https://www.suse.com"> SUSE Linux Enterprise Server</a>.
					Desktop Linux distributions include a windowing system such as X11 or Wayland, and a desktop
					environment such as GNOME or KDE Plasma. Distributions intended for servers may omit
					graphics altogether, or include a solution stack such as LAMP. Because Linux is freely
					redistributable, anyone may create a distribution for any purpose.<sup>[19]</sup>

				<h2>History</h2>

				<h3>Precursors</h3>
				<hr>
				<p>
					The Unix operating system was conceived and implemented in 1969, at AT&T's Bell Labs,
					in the United States by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Douglas McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna.<sup>[40]</sup>
					First released in 1971, Unix was written entirely in assembly language, as was common practice
					at the time. In 1973 in a key, pioneering approach, it was rewritten in the C programming
					language by Dennis Ritchie (with the exception of some hardware and I/O routines). The
					availability of a high-level language implementation of Unix made its porting to different
					computer platforms easier.<sup>[41]</sup>

				<h2> Assorted HTML Elements </h2>

				<h3>Divs and Spans</h3>
				<hr/>
				<p>
					These are ways to delimit and group content which will prove very
					useful when dealing with CSS.
					<div>
						Divs are block elements
					</div>

					Everything in parentheses is a span <span>(this is a span)</span>
					<span>(spans are inline elements)</span>.
				</p>

				<h3>Sup and Sub</h3>
				<hr/>
				<p>
					<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> * <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>
				</p>

				<h3>Line Breaks</h3>
				<hr/>
				<h4>Aqu√≠ - Octavio Paz</h4>
				<p>
					Mis pasos en esta calle<br/>
					Resuenan<br/>
					En otra calle<br/>
					Donde<br/>
					Oigo mis pasos<br/>
					Pasar en esta calle<br/>
					Donde<br/>
					S√≥lo es real la niebla<br/>
				</p>

				<h3>HTML Entities</h3>
				<hr/>
				<h4>Reserved characters</h4>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>&amp;</li>
						<li>&gt;</li>
						<li>&lt;</li>
						<li>&quot;</li>
						<li>&apos;</li>
					</ul>
					Double and single quotes can be written safely as long as
					they are not part of tag attributes in which case, the same
					rules as python apply. "They're awesome" and 'He said "Hey"'
					are valid, 'They're awesome' or "He said "Hey"" are not.
				</p>
				<div>

				</div>

				<h4>Difficult to write symbols</h4>
				<p>
					HTML entities for Unicode, some have standard names and they all
					have decimal and hexadecimal representations.
				</p>
				<p>
					&spades;
					&hearts;
					&clubs;
					&diams;
					&#8476;
					&#x02131;
				</p>
				<p>
					These are not really necessary for Emacs users since browsers interpret
					literal Unicode symbols and with Emacs you can just M-x insert-char
					(C-x 8 RET) to choose any Unicode symbol.
				</p>

				<h2>Semantic HTML</h2>
				<hr/>
				<p>
					Semantic HTML helps create meaningful sections in a webpage. Instead
					of grouping everything in divs, HTML provides alternatives that are
					functionally the same as divs, but indicate the meaning of each section.
					This is not only useful for code readability but also for SEO (Search
					Engine Optimization).
				</p>
				<p>
					Some semantic elements
					<ul>
						<li>header</li>
						<li>footer</li>
						<li>nav</li>
						<li>main</li>
						<li>article</li>
						<li>section</li>
						<li>aside</li>
						<li>summary</li>
						<li>details</li>
					</ul>
